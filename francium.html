          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in 1939 when she was researching radioactive decay of Actinium. The
            name comes from the country of discovery, France. Francium is the last known naturally occuring element to be
            discovered.</p>

          <p>Francium is a highly radioactive metal but because there's so little of it on the planet at any time, there's no
            appearance or characteristic data for it. It's likely a metallic solid that reacts explosively with water.</p>
          <p>It's yet to be subjected to a burn test so it's impossible to say how it would react during one.</p>
