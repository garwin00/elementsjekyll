          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>Caesium was almost discovered by Carl Plattner in 1846 but it wasn't until 1860 that it was discovered by Robert
            Bunsen and Gustav Kirchoff when they examined mineral water with spectroscopic analysis. The name comes from
            the blue lines observed in it's spectrum, and is derived from the latin for sky blue, 'Caesius'.</p>

          <p>Caesium is a soft, gold-white metal that tarnishes within seconds of being exposed to air. Due to the low melting
            point of Caesium, it's often found in liquid form also. It's attacked quickly in air and reacts very explosively
            in water. It burns with a lavender flame.</p>
          <p>Caesium is naturally occuring but in very small quantities so it's unknown if it's under risk of running out, and
            there's no way to know who produces the most.</p>

          <h3>Uses</h3>
          <p>Caesium compounds are often used in drilling fluids. They're also used to make special glass for vacuum tubes and
            in radiation monitoring equipment.</p>
          <p>Caesium is also used in atomic clocks and is a vital part of satellites and phone networks as they frequency of
            a caesium atom gives a standard measure (9.192 million cycles per second).</p>
