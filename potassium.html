          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>Potassium has been known in some form for centuries - (Potassium Nitrate, KNO3), alum (Potassium Aluminium Sulfate,
            KAl(SO4)2), and potash (Potassium Carbonate, K2CO3) have been used for gunpowder, dyeing and soap making. In
            1807 Humphry Davy introduced some Potassium salts to electrical current and found raw Potassium forming. The
            name 'Potassium' comes from the English 'potash' and the symbol 'K' comes from the Latin word 'Kalium'.</p>

          <p>Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metal that tarnishes within seconds of being exposed to air. Like all alkali
            metals, Potassium is highly reactive with water and burns with a lavender flame.</p>
          <p>Potassium has a supply risk of 4.5, meaning that it's relatively abundant and not in risk of running out in the
            immediate future. The top 3 producers are Canada, Russia and Belarus.</p>

          <h3>Uses</h3>
          <p>Potassium compounds are in high demand as plant fertilisers, however they're are also used in the making of glass
            (Potassium Carbonate), soaps (Potassium Hydroxide) and in saline drips (Potassium Chloride).</p>
          <p>Potassium is essential to life and is found in all cells. It's essential in maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance.</p>
